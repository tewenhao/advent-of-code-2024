# Day 3 Part 1

## Thought Process

Since we are only extracting out one pattern, it seems quite straightforward to just use regex to extract out any parts of the input text that has the required pattern `mul(x,y)` where `x` and `y` are both integers.

The final answer is `184122457`.

## Reflections

First time using regex in Rust. Not the most fun lol. But! Most things I picked up can be found [here](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/).
